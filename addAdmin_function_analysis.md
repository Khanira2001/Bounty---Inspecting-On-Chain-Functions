Function Code
```solidity
function addAdmin(address newAdmin) public {
    require(msg.sender == root, "only root can add admin");
    adminList.push(newAdmin);
    emit AdminAdded(newAdmin);
}
```

Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method
`abi.encode`

Explanation

Purpose

The `addAdmin` function is designed to add a new administrator to the `adminList`. This function ensures that only the root address, which is the owner or a privileged entity, has the authority to add new administrators. The addition of administrators is crucial for managing the protocol's operations and ensuring that only authorized addresses can perform specific administrative tasks.

Detailed Usage

The `abi.encode` method is often used in scenarios where data needs to be encoded into a specific format before being used or stored. In this case, the `addAdmin` function doesn’t explicitly show the use of `abi.encode` in the code snippet provided, but typically in more complex scenarios within the same contract or related contracts, `abi.encode` might be used to encode the function call data.

For instance, if this `addAdmin` function were to be called through a proxy contract or via a multi-signature wallet, the data might be encoded using `abi.encodeWithSignature` or `abi.encodeWithSelector` to format the function call correctly.

Here’s an example of how `abi.encode` could be used in conjunction with this function:
```solidity
bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("addAdmin(address)", newAdmin);
(bool success, ) = address(this).call(data);
require(success, "call to addAdmin failed");
```
In this example, `abi.encodeWithSignature` is used to create the call data for the `addAdmin` function. This encoded data is then used to make a low-level call to the contract itself.

Impact
The use of `abi.encode` or similar encoding functions allows for flexible and dynamic interaction with smart contracts. By encoding function calls, contracts can interact with each other in a standardized way, ensuring that the correct data is passed and functions are executed as intended.

In the context of the `addAdmin` function, encoding the function call data allows for seamless integration with other contracts or systems that may need to add administrators. This is especially important in a protocol like Centrifuge, where multiple contracts and entities need to interact in a secure and coordinated manner.

By leveraging encoding functions, Centrifuge can maintain a high level of security and functionality, ensuring that administrative tasks are performed correctly and efficiently, thereby enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the protocol.

Conclusion
The `addAdmin` function in the Tinlake Root Contract of the Centrifuge protocol showcases the importance of using encoding functions like `abi.encode` to facilitate secure and efficient contract interactions. This function plays a vital role in managing the protocol’s administrative tasks, ensuring that only authorized entities can add new administrators, thereby maintaining the integrity and security of the system.
